# About 

Grub 'n' Go is a Meteor application allowing users a convenient way to see available dining options/menus on campus. Our main goal is to help students go out and enjoy foods that they want to eat, giving information about vendors and what they sell. 

Anyone with a UH account can login to Grub 'n' Go by clicking on the login button. The UH CAS authentication screen then appears and requests your UH account and password.
 
Once authenticated, you can create a profile that provides a biographical statement and list of interests, plus links to selected social media sites (GitHub, FaceBook, Instagram):

  
After creating a profile, you will be listed on the public directory page:


Grub 'n' Go also provides a filter page, available to those who can login to the system with their UH account. The filter page allows you to display all portfolios with a given interest:


# User Guide
## Landing
User will first see the landing page, giving them a quick sense of what GrubNGo is about. A map will also be displayed which gives the user a sense of where all the food options are located.

## Vendors List
The vendors list is the complete list of food establishments on UH Manoa. Here, users can also filter food choices to best suit their current cravings. 

There are two types of users: Users and Vendors.
### If User:
## Register/Login
Users can either register if this is their first time and login if they have an existing account. Although a user can use the site regardless if they have an account or not, there are benefits for creating an account such as: liking favorite menu items and having a daily feed.
To create an account, all the user must input is their email and create a password.

## User Homepage
Once the user logs in, they’ll be redirected to their homepage, which showcases their favorite locations and a feed displaying if their favorite dish is being served today.

### If Vendor:
## Register/Login
Along with their email and password, vendors are required to input more information. Vendors will also input their name, location (on campus), hours, food category/tags, and with the option to write down their personal site.

## Vendor Homepage
Once the vendor logs in, they’ll be redirected to their homepage. It’ll display a list of their menu items categorized by food/drinks/other with the option to edit. Editing will allow them to add/remove an item from their list and mark an option sold out.

# Development History

## Milestone 1: Mockup development

This milestone started on April 2nd, 2018 and ended on April 12th, 2018.

The goal of Milestone 1 was to create the functional requirements for our application which includes: having our system deployed to Galaxy, have a landing page (with a login) and mockups of at least four other pages. Additionally there are software engineering requirements that includes using GitHub issues and a GitHub project called "M1" and practicing Issue Driven Project Management strategies. Lastly, there are home page requirements for our project's github home page. This includes (but not limited to): a link to the Github organization of this project, up-to-date screenshots, link to the running deployment of our system on Galaxy, link to the M1 project page and a link to the M2 project page.

Mockups for the following four pages were developed and then implemented during M1:
### 1. Landing

Milestone 1 was implemented as [Grub 'n' Go GitHub Milestone M1](https://github.com/grubngo/GrubNGo/projects/1):

Each issue was implemented in its own branch, and merged into master when completed:


## Milestone 2: Data model development 

This milestone started on April 13th, 2018 and ended on April 24th, 2018.

The goal of Milestone 2 was to significantly improve the functionality and quality of our application beyond the first M1 and improve our software engineering process beyond M1.

Additionally, we had to find at least 5 UH community members to test our application and give feedback and update our organization's GitHub page to document the current version of our system.


Milestone 2 consisted of two issues, and progress was managed via the [Grub 'n' Go GitHub Project M2](https://github.com/grubngo/GrubNGo/projects/2):


Each issue was implemented in its own branch, and merged into master when completed:
